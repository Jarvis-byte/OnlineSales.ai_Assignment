I am pleased to announce the development of my new mathematical expression calculation app, built entirely in Java. This app offers users a seamless experience for solving mathematical expressions using a free REST API, making complex calculations easier than ever.

**Key Features:**
- **Mathematical Expression Calculation:** The app allows users to input mathematical expressions and swiftly calculates the results using a free REST API, ensuring accurate and quick solutions.

- **Two-Page Interface:** Our app features a user-friendly interface with two distinct pages. The first page is dedicated to performing real-time mathematical calculations, while the second page serves as a comprehensive history log.

- **History Tracking:** Users can conveniently access a complete history of all their past mathematical calculations. This feature is designed to help users keep track of their work and revisit previous calculations.

- **Retrofit Integration:** To communicate with the REST API, we have integrated Retrofit, a powerful library for making HTTP requests. This ensures reliable and efficient data exchange with the API.

- **SQLite Database with ROOM:** For storing and managing calculation history, we have implemented an SQLite database using ROOM, a well-known database library for Android. This choice simplifies data access and ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Intuitive UI:** We have taken great care to create a simple and intuitive user interface. Our aim is to make mathematical calculations accessible to users of all skill levels, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

We are excited to share this app with you and hope you find it valuable in your day-to-day mathematical tasks. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated as we continue to improve and enhance the app. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your positive experience with our Java-based mathematical expression calculation app.
