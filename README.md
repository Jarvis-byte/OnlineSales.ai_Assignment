**Key Features:**
- **Mathematical Expression Calculation:** The app allows users to input mathematical expressions and swiftly calculates the results using a free REST API, ensuring accurate and quick solutions.

- **Two-Page Interface:** Our app features a user-friendly interface with two distinct pages. The first page is dedicated to performing real-time mathematical calculations, while the second page serves as a comprehensive history log.

- **History Tracking:** Users can conveniently access a complete history of all their past mathematical calculations. This feature is designed to help users keep track of their work and revisit previous calculations.

- **Retrofit Integration:** To communicate with the REST API, I have integrated Retrofit, a powerful library for making HTTP requests. This ensures reliable and efficient data exchange with the API.

- **SQLite Database with ROOM:** For storing and managing calculation history, I have implemented an SQLite database using ROOM, a well-known database library for Android. This choice simplifies data access and ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Intuitive UI:** I have taken great care to create a simple and intuitive user interface. Our aim is to make mathematical calculations accessible to users of all skill levels, ensuring a hassle-free experience.

## Installation and Building

To run the app from the source code, follow these steps:
